Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I am Emmely Bouter, a tattoo artist from Groningen. I've been a tattoo artist since the beginning of the Corona pandemic.
I've got my own tattoo studio in the southern part of the city Groningen.

I find it difficult to exactly describe my tattoo style, but the galleries I've compiled on this website should give you a pretty good idea.
The galleries on this website are, however, just a small selection of my work. If you're curious about the rest, feel free to check [my instagram](https://www.instagram.com/moonstone.ink.tattoos)
