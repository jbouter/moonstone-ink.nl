    "My name is Emmely. I've been tattooing since June 2020",
    "I'm tattooing part-time, but I'm working very hard to achieve my dream of becoming a full-time tattoo artist. I chose the name Moonstone Ink for my business for a special reason. I wear moonstones in most of my jewelry. Moonstones are connected to feminine energy, stimulate creativity, and help you through personal changes. I thought it was a perfect match for this new chapter of my life.",
